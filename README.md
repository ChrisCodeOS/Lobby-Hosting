# Lobby-Hosting
A Discord Bot used to host Lobbies. Includes a Lobby Code, PlayerList, and Interactable UI.

Currently this Bot is Coded to only work in a certain server. This could be changed my modifying the desired ChannelID that the discord Bot uses.

Commits will be made in the future to make changing the ChannelIDs easier or even not nessecary but currently this is just a hobby project that im using in a server. (excuse for spaghetti code)

If you find any bugs feel free to Dm me @polishbot on discord :D
